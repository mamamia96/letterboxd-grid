## TODO

<<<<<<< HEAD
- make grid dynamically resize
=======
- find how to get letterboxd movie url from rss feed **OR** use tmdb api
>>>>>>> 8cfc9d8 (started using rss feed to get data instead of looking through front-end. Not going to be using threads anymore since selenium shouldn't be required for getting data. Tried to get data in more functional programming style. Very fun session :))
